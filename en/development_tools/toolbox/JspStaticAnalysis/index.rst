.. tip::
  This tool was called "JSP Static Analysis Tool" until Nablarch5.
  However, as Java EE was transferred to the Eclipse Foundation and the specification name changed, the name was changed to "Jakarta Server Pages Static Analysis Tool".

  Only the name has changed, there is no functional difference.

  For other features renamed in Nablarch 6, see :ref:`renamed_features_in_nablarch_6`.
