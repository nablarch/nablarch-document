Example
=======

Example is an implementation example that demonstrates how to use the features of the Nablarch Application Framework, and is created for each :ref:`runtime platform <runtime_platform>`.
This chapter describes the procedures for building the environment and executing the application, which are necessary for each Example.


  .. tip::
    Example is not intended to be used to create a full-fledged applications by modifying each Example.
    If you want to create a full-fledged application, create it from :ref:`blank_project`.
