Functional Comparison Between Universal DAO and Jakarta Persistence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section compares the following functions:

* :ref:`Universal DAO <universal_dao>`
* |JSR317|

.. important::

  Universal DAO supports only those annotations listed in  :ref:`universal_dao_jpa_annotations`  among the annotations defined in JPA. 
  Functions related to annotations not described here cannot be used.

    - A

  * - Can execute arbitrary processing (callback call) |br| before and after database access
    - C [#callback]_
    - A

  * - Exclusive control is possible
    - B [#lock]_ |br| :ref:`To the manual(optimistic lock) <universal_dao_jpa_optimistic_lock>` |br| :ref:`To the manual(pessimistic lock) <universal_dao_jpa_pessimistic_lock>`
    - A

.. [#relation] Searching for tables with relationships can be supported by creating SQL. Registration, update and deletion are handled by calling the necessary function for each table. 
.. [#criteria] Universal DAO can perform dynamic processing only for conditions and sort items. For details, see :ref:`SQL dynamic assembly <database-variable_condition>` 
.. [#validaiton] Nablarch performs validation when data is received from the outside, and converts to Entity and saves to database only when there is no validation error.
.. [#callback] If an arbitrary process is required, it is handled by the process that calls the universal DAO.
.. [#lock] Universal DAO only supports optimistic locking. Pessimistic lock or lock mode specification at the time of search defined in Jakarta Persistence are not supported. (Pessimistic lock can be realized by using  ``select for update`` .)
