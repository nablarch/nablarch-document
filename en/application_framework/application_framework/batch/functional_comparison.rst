.. [#jsr]
  Z parts are in accordance with the specifications defined in Jakarta Batch.
  For details, refer to the specification of `Jakarta Batch (external site) <https://jakarta.ee/specifications/batch/>`_.

.. [#jsr_max]
  The property to specify the maximum number to read in a single run
  can be included in the implementation class :java:extdoc:`ItemReader <jakarta.batch.api.chunk.ItemReader>`.

.. [#resumable]
  Re-execution from the point of failure is possible by using
  :java:extdoc:`ResumeDataReader (read with resume function)<nablarch.fw.reader.ResumeDataReader>`.
  However, this feature is available only when a file is input.
  When other data is input, design and implementation are required in the application.

.. [#skip_exception]
  Add a handler to continue processing ignoring specific exceptions.

.. [#retry_exception]
  :ref:`retry_handler` retries for exceptions that can be retried,
  but a simple retry cannot be performed for data where an exception has occurred,
  as in Jakarta Batch. Exceptions to be retried cannot be specified flexibly with :ref:`retry_handler`.

  If the requirements cannot be met with the :ref:`retry_handler`
  (simple retry of the data where the exception occurred or to specify the exception flexibly),
  provide support by adding a handler.

.. [#branch_batch]
  Use a job scheduler, etc. For example, taking measures such as switching the job
  to be executed next based on the exit code will be necessary.

.. [#resident_batch]
  In Jakarta Batch-compliant batch applications, it is not possible to realize a batch process
  for monitoring an input data source at regular intervals.
  For this reason, if such a batch application is necessary,
  realize using  :ref:`the resident batch of Nablarch batch application <nablarch_batch-resident_batch>`.
