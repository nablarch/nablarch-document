.. tip::
  This function was called "JSR352-compliant Batch Application" until Nablarch5.
  However, as Java EE was transferred to the Eclipse Foundation and the specification name changed, the name was changed to "Jakarta Batch-compliant Batch Application".

  Only the name has changed, there is no functional difference.

  For other features renamed in Nablarch 6, see :ref:`renamed_features_in_nablarch_6`.
