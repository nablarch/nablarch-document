.. [1] HTTP messaging is not designed in consideration of REST. Use Jakarta RESTful Web Services support for RESTful web services.
.. [2] Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection is not available because Jakarta RESTful Web Services support and HTTP messaging run as Nablarch web applications.
.. [3] Create a handler for creating a request/response filter.
.. [4] Create a BodyConverter with Jakarta RESTful Web Services support for creating an interceptor to read and write the body.
.. [5] Use data format of Nablarch to read and write the body. Create a DataRecordFormatter to change the data format.
.. [6] If Jakarta RESTful Web Services client is needed, use a Jakarta RESTful Web Services implementation (such as Jersey or RESTEasy).
.. [7] It is assumed that asynchronous operation in the server is not required. Support will be considered if there is a request.
.. [8] Use the function to check the request size on the web server or application server.
.. [9] Each application is assumed to have different requirements. Design/implement in the application.
.. [10] If a service availability check in Nablarch matches the application's requirements, use the check. If a check does not match, design/implement the check in the application.
.. [11] Use the transaction management available in Nablarch.
.. [12] Error handling is assumed to be common and JaxRsResponseHandler is assumed to be customized. To handle errors individually in business operations, use try/catch in resource methods.
