The following is procedures of initial setup of the Jakarta Batch-compliant batch project:

* Generate a Jakarta Batch-compliant batch project
* Confirm communications of the Jakarta Batch-compliant batch project


Overview of the generated project
=========================================================

The overview of the project generated by this procedure is as follows.

    - Maven project
  * - Project composition
    - Single project composition
  * - DB used
    - H2 Database Engine (embedded in the application)

      * Batch application for communication confirmation by the batchlet architecture
      * Batch application for communication confirmation by the chunk architecture
      * Initial configuration of the tool that operates in conjunction with Maven (is imported by referring to :ref:`about_maven_parent_module`).


For relationship with other projects and directories, see :doc:`../MavenModuleStructures/index`.


.. _firstStepGenerateBatchEEBlankProject:

Create blank project
=======================================================

Generate a blank project using the archetypes provided by Nablarch.


Execute the mvn command
-------------------------------------------------------

Use `Maven Archetype Plugin(external site) <https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/usage.html>`_ to generate a blank project.

Change the current directory to the directory where the blank project (can be any directory) is to be created.

Execute the following command.

.. code-block:: bat

  mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.nablarch.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=nablarch-batch-ee-archetype -DarchetypeVersion={nablarch_version}

The version of nablarch used in the above command is |nablarch_version|. If you want to change the version, change the following parameters.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :class: white-space-normal
  :widths: 6,20

  * - Set value
    - Description
  * - archetypeVersion
    - Specify the version of the archetype you wish to use. (Nablarch 6u2 or later must be specified)

Enter project information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the above command is executed, you will be asked to enter the following information about the blank project to be generated.

=========== ================================================= =======================
Input item  Description                                       Configuration example
=========== ================================================= =======================
groupId      Group ID (normally, enter the package name)      ``com.example``
artifactId   Artifact ID                                      ``myapp-batch-ee``
version      Version number                                   ``0.1.0``
package      Package (normally the same as group ID)          ``com.example``
=========== ================================================= =======================

.. important::
   Item groupId and package are mapped to the Java package name.
   Use lowercase letters, numbers, and dots for these input values, and do not use hyphens.

When you have finished entering project information, Y: : will appear.

 * Enter 「Y」 if you want to generate a template based on the information you have entered.
 * Enter 「N」 if you wish to redo the project information entry.

If the command ends normally, a blank project is created under the current directory.


.. _firstStepBatchEEStartupTest:

Communication confirmation
=====================================================

Automated test
-----------------------------------------------------

The following unit tests are included in the project generated from the archetype.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :class: white-space-normal
  :widths: 9,20

  * - Unit test classes
    - Test content
  * - SampleBatchletTest
    - JUnit test for classes with database connection.


Execute the unit test and confirm that the blank project was successfully generated.

Execute the following command.

.. code-block:: text

  cd myapp-batch-ee
  mvn test


If the execution is successful, the log given below will be output to the console.

.. code-block:: text

  (Omitted)

Launch test
--------------------------------------------------------

The following batch applications are incorporated in the project that is generated.

=================== ================================================================================
Job ID              Details
=================== ================================================================================
sample-chunk        Sample application implemented by the chunk architecture.
sample-batchlet     Sample application implemented by the batchlet architecture.
=================== ================================================================================


Confirm the communications of the above 2 batch applications and confirm that the blank project has been successfully generated.


.. _firstStepBatchEEBuild:

Build a batch application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the current directory is not yet moved to the generated project, move the directory.

.. code-block:: text

  cd myapp-batch-ee


Execute the following command to build the batch application.

.. code-block:: text

  mvn package

Launch the batch application of the chunk architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The batch application of the chunk architecture implements the process to extract data from the SAMPLE_USER table, edit the data, and output data to a CSV file.

Execute the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=nablarch.fw.batch.ee.Main -Dexec.args="'sample-chunk'"

If the launch is successful, the log given below will be output to ``./progress.log``.

.. code-block:: text

.. tip::

  testdata/output/outputdata.csv is output in UTF-8.
  When checking the contents of testdata testdata/output/outputdata.csv, open the file with a text editor as the contents will be garbled if opened with excel.


Launch the batch application of the batchlet architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The batch application of the batchlet architecture implements the process to delete the data of the SAMPLE_USER table.

Execute the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=nablarch.fw.batch.ee.Main -Dexec.args="'sample-batchlet'"

If the execution is successful, the log given below will be output to ``./progress.log``.

.. tip::

  This batchlet deletes all the data in the SAMPLE_USER table. To recover deleted data, refer to :ref:`firstStepBatchEEProjectStructure` and copy "SAMPLE.mv.db.org" to "SAMPLE.mv.db".



If the communication confirmation fails for some reason
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the communication confirmation fails for some unknown reason, the correct procedure may not have been followed in some part.

If the reason is not known, try again from :ref:`firstStepGenerateBatchEEBlankProject`.
