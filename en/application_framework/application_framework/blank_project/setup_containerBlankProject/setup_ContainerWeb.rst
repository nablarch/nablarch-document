Initial Setup of Web Project for Container
----------------------------------------------------------

The following is configured in the initial setup of the web project for container:

* Generating web project for container
* Confirm communications of web project
* Create a container image
* Run Container Image


Overview of the generated project
----------------------------------------------------------

The overview of the project generated by this procedure is as follows.

For relationship with other projects and directories, see :doc:`../MavenModuleStructures/index`.


.. _firstStepGenerateContainerWebBlankProject:

Create blank project
----------------------------------------------------------

Generate a blank project using the archetypes provided by Nablarch.

Execute the mvn command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `Maven Archetype Plugin(external site) <https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/usage.html>`_ to generate a blank project.

Change the current directory to the directory where the blank project (can be any directory) is to be created and place the following file.

:download:`Batch file <bat/generateContainerWebProject.bat>`

After placing the file, specify the necessary parameters in the arguments and execute the bat file.

generateContainerWebProject.bat |nablarch_version| <<groupId>> <<artifactId>> <<version>> <<package(optional)>>

The parameters to be set in the above command are as follows.
If you want to change the version of nablarch, change |nablarch_version| .

=========== ================================================= =======================
Input item  Description                                       Configuration example
=========== ================================================= =======================
groupId      Group ID (normally, enter the package name)      ``com.example``
artifactId   Artifact ID                                      ``myapp-container-web``
version      Version number                                   ``0.1.0``
package      Package (normally the same as group ID)          ``com.example``
=========== ================================================= =======================

.. important::
   Item groupId and package are mapped to the Java package name.
   Use lowercase letters, numbers, and dots for these input values, and do not use hyphens.

If the command ends normally, a blank project is created under the current directory.


.. _firstStepContainerWebStartupTest:

Communication confirmation
-------------------------------------------

The mechanism and procedure for checking communication is the same as for a normal web project, so refer to :ref:`Initial Setup of Web Project <firstStepWebStartupTest>` .

.. note::

  The artifact ID should be replaced with ``myapp-container-web`` to specify the directory and command.


.. _firstStepBuildContainerWebDockerImage:

Create a container image
----------------------------------

The blank project has a plugin named `Jib <https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin>`_ (External sites, English) built in to create an image of a Docker container.

The ``jib: dockerBuild`` goal of this plugin can be executed to create a container image.

.. code-block:: text

  cd myapp-container-web
  mvn package jib:dockerBuild


If the execution is successful, the log given below will be output to the console.

.. code-block:: text

  (omission)
  [INFO] Built image to Docker daemon as myapp-container-web, myapp-container-web, myapp-container-web:0.1.0
  [INFO] Executing tasks:
  [INFO] [==============================] 100.0% complete
  [INFO]
  [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
  [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (Omitted)

Built Docker images are stored in a local repository.
Can see the images stored in the local repository with the following command.

.. code-block:: text

  docker image ls
  REPOSITORY              TAG         IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
  myapp-container-web     0.1.0       dd60cbdc7722   50 years ago   449MB
  myapp-container-web     latest      dd60cbdc7722   50 years ago   449MB

Can see that there are 2 images registered: ``myapp-container-web:0.1.0`` and ``myapp-container-web:latest`` .

Thus, ``jib:dockerBuild`` on a blank project is set to create two images:.

* ``${project.artifactId}:latest``
* ``${project.artifactId}:${project.version}``

`Tomcat image <https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat>`_ (External sites, English) is used as base image by default.

The base image is specified in ``pom.xml`` in ``nablarch-archetype-parent`` but can be changed with the ``jib.from.image`` property.
For example, if you want to use ``tomcat:9.0.31-jdk11-adoptopenjdk-hotspot`` for your base image, you would write it in ``pom.xml`` .

.. code-block:: xml

  <project>
    <! -- Omitted ...-->
    <properties>
      <! -- Omitted ...-->
      <!-- tomcat:9.0.31-jdk11-adoptopenjdk-hotspot -->
      <jib.from.image>tomcat@sha256:e1f3ec646689c558bdd1a8b7045c5eed7c0ca9dbe664a82ba47d1591e3c5faf0</jib.from.image>
    </properties>
    <! -- Omitted ...-->
  </project>

.. tip::

  Docker image tags are not immutable and may be updated.
  Therefore, it is recommended to use a digest to specify the base image.

.. _firstStepRunContainerWebDockerImage:

Run a container image
----------------------------------

Once you have created a container image, you can run it with the following command.

.. code-block:: text

  cd myapp-container-web
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v %CD%\h2:/usr/local/tomcat/h2 --name myapp-container-web myapp-container-web

Once the container is up and running, you can check the application in your web browser by accessing ``http://localhost:8080/`` .

.. tip::

  The above command is an example of the case where SAMPLE.h2.db, which is included in the blank project beforehand, is used as the database.
  If you do not use SAMPLE.h2.db, you do not need to specify a volume (``-v``).

.. tip::

  Running Docker assumes you are using Docker Desktop :ref:`Prerequisite <firstStepPreamble>` .
  If you are using the Docker Toolbox, the volume specification in the above example will fail.

  If you are using the Docker Toolbox, Docker is running in a VM on VirtualBox.
  Therefore, the path that can be specified on the host side of the volume is the path on the VM.

  On Windows, by default ``C:\Users`` is mounted in ``/c/users`` on the VM.
  Thus, if you are using the Docker Toolbox, you must specify the volume as ``-v/c/users/path/to/project/h2:/usr/local/tomcat/h2`` .

To exit the container, execute the following command.

.. code-block:: text

  docker stop myapp-container-web

To delete a container, execute the following command.

.. code-block:: text

  docker rm myapp-container-web
